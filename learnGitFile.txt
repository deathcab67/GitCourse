This is a file just for learning git
I need to make good notes so that I can share what I learn.

When you create something or change something in a .git enabled space
git will know what files have changed or have been created
git status will show what state files need to be "added" and "commit"
git repositories work in the directory they are in and sub directories. So items in external directories are not tracked.

git add to add changed/created files
git commit with -m "change info here"
git status to confirm commit
git log lists all of the changes w/messges
    you can use git log to inform where you want to rollback to if you would like to.
if you need to roll back to a previous version:
git log -- to get the hash of the version you want
git checkout <hash> filename
git status to confirm you have checked out the file
git commit -m "your message"
how to handle two files at different states
